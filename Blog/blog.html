                    “According to this law [the law of Dharma], you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. <br>There is something that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world--and for every unique talent <br> and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs are matched with the<br> creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence. Expressing your talents to fulfill <br>needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.”
                    “If you focus on success, you’ll have stress. But if you pursue<br> excellence, success will be guaranteed.”
                    “To make the right choices in life, you have to get in touch with your<br> soul. To do this, you need to experience solitude, which most people are afraid of, because in the silence you<br> hear the truth and know the solutions.”
                    “people are doing the best that they can from their own level of consciousness.”

        <p>Steve Jobs, in full Steven Paul Jobs, (born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died October 5, 2011, Palo Alto, California), cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era.
            Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon Valley. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism.
            Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
